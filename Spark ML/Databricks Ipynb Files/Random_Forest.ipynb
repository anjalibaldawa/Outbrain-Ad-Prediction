Build a schema of a source data for its Data Frame\n2. Load the Source Data to the schema\n3. Prepare the data with the features (input columns, output column as label)\n4. Split the data using data.randomSplit(): Training and Testing\n5. Transform the columns to a vector using VectorAssembler\n6. set features and label from the vector\n7. Build a ***Random Forest Algorithm*** Model with the label and features\n8. Train the model\n9. Prepare the testing Data Frame with features and label from the vector; Rename label to trueLabel\n10.
